# Projects

**Effects of tourism on income and education in the youth population: the case of El Salvador**

In recent years, El Salvador has experienced an increase in its tourism activity. This project seeks to quantify the impacts of this shock on per capita income and years of schooling in the youth population of the departments designated as key for tourism. The databases of the El Salvador [household survey](https://onec.bcr.gob.sv/metadatos/index.php/catalog#_r=&collection=&country=&dtype=7&from=2007&page=1&ps=&sid=&sk=&sort_by=title&sort_order=&to=2020&topic=&view=s&vk=) between 2010 and 2023 were used.

- **Results:** The results after applying a LASSO regression suggest a positive effect on the per capita income of young people, however no impact was found at the educational level.

**Neural Networks in Asset Pricing (*Aug 2024*)**

As part of my master program at LMU, I took the seminar Machine Learning in Econometrics, where I implemented an Asset Pricing analysis using neural networks, based mainly on the work of [Gu et al. (2020)] (https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/33/5/2223/5758276) adding the "dropout" approach suggested by [Drobetz and Otto (2021)](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3640631) [Folder](/codes/NN-Pricing)

- **Results:** Under certain modifications, the superiority of the state-of-the-art ML models is maintained, even when the subsample size is reduced.
