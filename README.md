**Double Machine Learning for Panel Data: Application to R&D Investment (Master Thesis)**

_Abstract:_ Research and development (R&D) is a crucial element for boosting firm innovation, productivity, and long-run competitiveness, but its level often depends on firm characteristics. This thesis estimates the causal effect of three financial ratios- Return-on-Assets (ROA), leverage, and the Market-to-Book (M/B) ratio- on R&D intensity. To do so, the analysis uses a balanced panel of 331 firms from Compustat Fundamental Annuals database (1980–2019), and applies Double Machine Learning (DML) method -via LASSO and XGBoost- adapted for panels: Correlated Random Effects (CRE), First-Difference (FD), and Neighbours-Leave-Out (NLO) cross-fitting. The results show a modest impact of these ratios: ROA tends to have a negative effect that is more stable under XGBoost but becomes statistically insignificant in joint models; leverage has a negative impact that is stable across learners; and the M/B ratio shows a small positive effect that fades once interactions of order greater than two are allowed. In sum, the findings indicate that leverage is the most stable factor among the different DML variants. However, its magnitude is weak and, like the other proposed drivers, its statistical significance disappears over time. This confirms a weak dependence in the sample and, therefore, the separation of temporal blocks is viable in firm-level studies.

**Effects of tourism on income and education in the youth population: the case of El Salvador**

In recent years, El Salvador has experienced an increase in its tourism activity. This project seeks to quantify the impacts of this shock on per capita income and years of schooling in the youth population of the departments designated as key for tourism. The databases of the El Salvador [household survey](https://onec.bcr.gob.sv/metadatos/index.php/catalog#_r=&collection=&country=&dtype=7&from=2007&page=1&ps=&sid=&sk=&sort_by=title&sort_order=&to=2020&topic=&view=s&vk=) between 2010 and 2023 were used.

- **Results:** The results after applying a LASSO regression suggest a positive effect on the per capita income of young people, however no impact was found at the educational level.

**Neural Networks in Asset Pricing (*Aug 2024*)**

As part of my master program at LMU, I took the seminar Machine Learning in Econometrics, where I implemented an Asset Pricing analysis using neural networks, based mainly on the work of [Gu et al. (2020)](https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/33/5/2223/5758276) adding the "dropout" approach suggested by [Drobetz and Otto (2021)](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3640631).

- **Results:** Under certain modifications, the superiority of the state-of-the-art ML models is maintained, even when the subsample size is reduced.
